# PantryPilot

A front-end prototype that helps non-professional home cooks answer one question:
**what should I cook with what I already have?**

**Author: Aaron Koo**  

Built for MGMT 6110 Human-AI Collaboration, Singapore Management University.

## Coursework documents

- [prompts.md](prompts.md) - the working log of how this was built, including the prompts and steps that went wrong.
- [REFLECTION.md](REFLECTION.md) - the five-question reflection for Problem Set 1, plus the further-action roadmap.
- [assessment.md](assessment.md) - Problem Set 2: twelve criteria set before any marking, the product marked against them with evidence, and the collaboration that produced it.
- [RANKING-RULES.md](RANKING-RULES.md) - what every rule that filters or orders the meal list does, with its numbers and a named owner. Nothing in v2 is scored.
- [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) - every version, newest first, and which document describes which.

> **Which version the documents describe.** `REFLECTION.md` describes the state tagged
> `v1-submitted`, which is what was handed in for Problem Set 1; it is a graded artefact and is
> not rewritten. `prompts.md` runs from the first prompt of Problem Set 1 through to the back end
> added for Problem Set 2, in one history, with the v1 sections left as they were written.
> `assessment.md`, `RANKING-RULES.md` and this file describe the current app. `git checkout v1-submitted` gives you exactly the graded version, and
> [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) lists everything that changed after it.

## The user journey

1. **Meal Setup** - tick the ingredients in your kitchen from 93, grouped and searchable, with
   meat and pantry items on a second level; say how many people are eating; pick a time budget
   (15 / 30 / 60+ minutes); and optionally narrow by cuisine (Chinese, Western, Thai) and by how
   heavy you want it (Light, Medium, Heavy). Press **Find Meals**.
2. **Meal Recommendations** - meal cards showing ingredient match, time, calories per person,
   price per person and servings. Sort by match, time, calories or price, in either direction;
   filter to vegetarian only, or to meals that need no extra shopping.
3. **Meal Detail** - the full recipe: what you have, what you still need and what the missing
   items cost, prep / cook / total time, price per person and for the whole dish, calories per
   person and in total, protein / carbs / fat both per serving and for the whole dish, and a
   serving-size control that rescales every quantity, every line price and the whole-dish totals
   while price per person and calories per person stay fixed. Then the numbered steps.

   Beneath the nutrition block sits **the one figure on the screen that is not ours**. Pick any
   ingredient in the recipe and PantryPilot fetches that ingredient's published nutrient record
   from USDA FoodData Central through its own serverless function, cites the record by id, and
   says which of the figures USDA measured and which it worked out. Every other nutrition number
   on the screen stays our own estimate, and the panel says so rather than leaving it inferred.

A cover screen sits above screen 1 for three seconds on arrival, showing the wordmark and nothing
else. Tap, click or any key skips it, and it is skipped outright for anyone whose system asks for
reduced motion. It used to carry a progress bar; that was deleted for Problem Set 2, because it
reported the progress of a timer against itself and announced it to assistive technology as the
application starting, while nothing was loading. `assessment.md` section 1 has the reasoning.

Time, cuisine and weight stay editable on screen 2, behind the "Time, cuisine and weight"
disclosure, and edits there write back to screen 1. The Find Meals button carries a live count
that moves as you tick ingredients.

A status row sits above every screen saying whether the live lookup is working, with a link to
`/api/health` for anyone who would rather read the raw answer than our summary of it.

All three screens live in one page, so moving between them never reloads the browser.

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the URL Vite prints (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

To produce a production build for Vercel:

```bash
npm run build
```

Vercel picks this up automatically as a Vite project (build command `npm run build`,
output directory `dist`).

## Scope and guardrails

- **One back end, added for Problem Set 2.** Two serverless functions at `api/`, and no
  database, no accounts and no analytics. `api/nutrition.js` asks USDA FoodData Central for one
  ingredient's published nutrient record; `api/health.js` reports whether the credential is
  configured and what the upstream answered.
- **The credential never leaves the server.** The only call that carries it happens inside `api/`,
  and the page makes no request to USDA itself.
  The credential lives in a Vercel environment variable named `USDA_API_KEY`, is read only as
  `process.env.USDA_API_KEY` inside `api/`, and is in no browser code and no commit. Nothing in
  this project is named with a `VITE_` prefix, because Vite writes those into the bundle every
  visitor downloads.
- **One third-party embed, on the first screen only.** The feedback thread at the bottom of the
  setup screen is Disqus, loaded from `aaronkoojy.disqus.com`. It is the only script the page
  fetches from anywhere but its own origin, it carries no credential of ours, and it is pinned to a
  single thread so all feedback lands in one place. Disqus sets its own cookies and receives the
  page address; nothing else is sent to it.
- **Everything else is still invented** and lives in `src/data/pantryData.js`. The app says so on
  screen, next to the one figure that is not.
- No real brands, restaurants, shops or delivery services are referenced.
- Nutrition figures are illustrative sample data for a prototype. They are **not**
  health, dietary or medical advice, and the app says so on screen.
- The name PantryPilot was chosen independently for this coursework prototype. No
  affiliation with any similarly named product or service is implied.
- Prices are invented sample figures in Singapore dollars. They are not real shop prices, and
  no shop is named or implied.
- Nothing in the app is scored. Cuisine, weight, vegetarian, time and "can cook now" all exclude;
  the four sorts are plain orderings with no weights. See [RANKING-RULES.md](RANKING-RULES.md).

## Files

| File | What it contains |
| --- | --- |
| `api/health.js` | **Serverless function.** Reports whether `USDA_API_KEY` is configured and what the upstream answered, and nothing further about the credential. `Cache-Control: no-store`, because the answer is about now. |
| `api/nutrition.js` | **Serverless function.** Takes a known ingredient id, validated against the catalogue before the credential is sent anywhere, and returns one USDA FoodData Central record. Restricted to analysed reference records, with `requireAllWords=true` so a miss is an honest empty rather than an unrelated food. |
| `index.html` | Vite entry page with the `#root` mount point. |
| `package.json` | React 18 + Vite dependencies and the `dev` / `build` / `preview` scripts. |
| `vite.config.js` | Standard Vite + React plugin config. |
| `src/main.jsx` | Mounts `<App />` into `#root` and loads the stylesheet. |
| `src/components/SplashScreen.jsx` | The cover screen. Three-second hold on the wordmark, skippable, skipped under reduced-motion. Asserts nothing: the progress bar it used to carry was deleted for Problem Set 2. |
| `src/App.jsx` | Root component. Holds setup, filter and screen state, computes the recommendation list, and switches between the three screens without reloading. |
| `src/data/pantryData.js` | **All invented data except the sourced panel's figures:** 93 ingredients with unit, price and vegetarian flag, and 47 meals across three cuisines with quantities, servings, times, macros, difficulty and category. Calories, weight band, vegetarian status and price are derived here, never authored. |
| `src/utils/mealMatching.js` | Pure logic: ingredient matching, filtering, sorting, serving scaling, pricing and formatting. |
| `src/components/MealSetup.jsx` | Screen 1. People, time, cuisine and weight controls plus the Find Meals button. |
| `src/components/IngredientPicker.jsx` | Screen 1's ingredient index: search, an echo of your picks, and collapsible categories with a second level for meat cuts and pantry cuisines, every header carrying item and selected counts. |
| `src/components/MealRecommendations.jsx` | Screen 2. Setup summary, filter bar, result count, meal list and empty state. |
| `src/components/FilterBar.jsx` | Sort dropdown with an ascending/descending control, the vegetarian and "only meals I can cook now" toggles, and a disclosure holding time, cuisine and weight. |
| `src/components/MealCard.jsx` | One meal summary card: name, match line and meter, time, calories, price, servings, tags and missing ingredients. |
| `src/components/MealDetail.jsx` | Screen 3. Tag row, serving control, have / need ingredient lists with per-line prices, times, cost, nutrition per serving and whole dish, steps and the back button. |
| `src/components/SourcedNutrition.jsx` | The one panel whose numbers are not ours. Calls `/api/nutrition`, cites the record, and says six different things across loading, empty, refused, unreachable, no credential and our own service being down. |
| `src/components/SiteFooter.jsx` | The standing credit to USDA FoodData Central, on every screen rather than only where a lookup succeeded, plus the standing statement that everything else is invented. |
| `src/components/DisqusThread.jsx` | The feedback thread at the bottom of the first screen. Loads the Disqus script once per page load and calls `DISQUS.reset` when the screen re-mounts, with `page.identifier` fixed to `home` so every visitor writes into one thread. |
| `src/components/ServiceStatus.jsx` | The standing status row on every screen. Reads `/api/health` on mount and every minute, states in one line whether the live lookup is working, and links to the raw endpoint. |
| `src/styles.css` | All styling. Mobile-first, warm palette, 48px touch targets on the primary controls; the compact "Clear all" (32px) and the second-level group headers (44px) are the two deliberate exceptions. |
