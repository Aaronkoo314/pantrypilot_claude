## v4 — one page at a time, feedback, and analytics

*Everything after the Problem Set 2 submission, tagged [`ps2-submitted`](../../releases/tag/ps2-submitted).
Layout and instrumentation only: no ingredient, recipe or ranking rule changed.*

### Changed

- **Setup is seven steps** instead of one page. Five ingredient categories in order, then two
  pages of questions — how many people and how long, then cuisine and how heavy. The categories
  and their second-level groups are exactly as they were; only the layout moved.

  Each page chooses its own shape by size. A large flat category leads with the six ingredients
  these recipes use most and hides the rest behind "See all". A large grouped one shows its
  second-level groups instead. A small one shows everything, because promoting six of seven items
  and hiding the last behind a link costs a tap to reveal nothing.

  Measured at 375px: 897–1102px per page, against a single page that was 1906px with every
  category collapsed and unbounded once one was opened.

- **The recipe screen is five pages** — Servings & time, Ingredients, Cost, Nutrition, How to cook
  it — with a row of section names to jump between them. Names rather than a progress bar, because
  reading a recipe has no required order: somebody at the stove wants the steps and somebody in
  the shop wants the cost. It was 4747px, or 5.8 screens.

- **The results screen lists your kitchen**, with an Edit link back into the picker. The header
  used to carry a "Change my kitchen" link and a count, which said how many ingredients were
  picked but not which, so checking meant leaving the screen.

- Every move between steps or sections lands at the top of the new page.

### Added

- **A feedback thread**, collapsed at the bottom of every page, hosted by Disqus and pinned to one
  thread by a fixed `page.identifier` and the live https URL — so a comment written from a preview
  build or from localhost still lands in the same conversation.

- **Microsoft Clarity**, in `index.html`, running only when the hostname is exactly
  `pantrypilot-phi.vercel.app`.

- **A notice in the footer of every screen** naming both third parties, with links to Microsoft's
  privacy statement and to Disqus's policy and data-sharing settings.

- **Clear all is undoable.** It was the only irreversible action in the product: fourteen
  ingredients ticked, one mis-tap, everything gone. A confirmation was rejected in favour of an
  undo — a dialog charges everybody a tap to protect the few who misfire.

### Fixed

- `.secondary-button` is `width: 100%` everywhere in the app, which inside the new flex button bar
  pushed the primary button 67px off the right edge at 375px. Overriding the flex basis was not
  enough; the width had to go too. Found by measuring, not by looking.

- Splitting setup into steps replaced the old page header and with it **"Cook what you already
  have"**, the only sentence on the first screen that said what the product was for — and the one
  line every classmate quoted when asked what it did. Restored, on page one only.

### Note on the feedback thread, because the first version undid the change it shipped with

Mounted open on every page, the Disqus embed is about 925px — 34% of the recipe steps page — and
it pushed all twelve pages to 1882–2087px, past the 1522px page the split had just been made to
eliminate. Twelve pages each carrying a thousand pixels of comment box is a longer app than the
one page it replaced.

It is now a single row that loads on the first tap. Measured after browsing all seven setup steps
with it closed: **zero requests to Disqus**. Most visitors never open it and should not pay for it.

### Note on the hostname gate

The Clarity check is an equality test rather than a suffix match on `.vercel.app`. This app is
served from a per-deployment hash URL, a preview build for every branch, and localhost — and a
suffix match would record all of them into the same project. What should reach Clarity is visitors
using the product, not the author reloading it.

### Still standing after this version

- The sourced nutrition panel returns "Lunchmeat, chicken breast, sliced" for Chicken Breast with
  all three macro values blank, and the function still reports `ok`. The product was correct at
  `ps2-submitted`; USDA published a record in April 2026 that now outranks the raw-chicken one.
  Nothing in this repository changed — the provider did.
- `FilterBar.jsx` prints the weight bands as raw ids: `light + medium` where everywhere else reads
  `Light` and `Medium`.
- The empty-state buttons do not say how many meals each would bring back.
- The difficulty tag is defined nowhere: two values across 47 meals, filtering nothing, sorting
  nothing, published by no source.

---

## v3 — a real back end, for Problem Set 2

*The first version of PantryPilot that depends on something outside this repository. One figure on
one screen is now published by somebody else, and the rest of the product had to learn what to say
when that somebody is not answering.*

### Added

- **Two serverless functions at `api/`**, at the repository root beside `package.json`, which is
  the only place Vercel runs them. `api/nutrition.js` returns one ingredient's published nutrient
  record from USDA FoodData Central. `api/health.js` reports whether the credential is configured
  and what the upstream answered, and nothing else about the credential.
- **A sourced nutrition panel** on the meal detail screen, beneath the invented macros, where the
  contrast is the point. It cites the record by id with a link to it, states whether USDA measured
  each figure or worked it out, and says that every other nutrition number on the screen is our own
  estimate.
- **A standing credit** to USDA FoodData Central in the footer of every screen, rather than only
  inside the panel where a lookup had succeeded. The licence asks to be listed as the source of the
  data, and that request does not lapse when the lookup is empty or refused — which was exactly the
  case on the four screens a user is most likely to see on a bad evening.
- **A service status row** on every screen, reading `/api/health` on mount and every minute after.
  It states in one line whether the live lookup is working and links to the raw endpoint. It
  reports its own failure rather than disappearing, because a status line that vanishes when things
  break is worse than none.
- **Six user-facing states** where a spinner would have been: loading, the source having no record,
  the provider refusing, the provider unreachable, no credential configured, and our own service
  down. The brief asked for four. The fifth and sixth exist because the first version reported a
  404 from our own address as "USDA refused the request", which blames the wrong party.
- **`assessment.md`** — twelve criteria written and committed before any marking, the product
  marked against them with evidence, and the collaboration assessed.

### Changed

- `PROMPTS.md` renamed to `prompts.md` and continued rather than restarted, so both problem sets
  sit in one history. The rename went through a temporary name because `core.ignorecase` is true in
  this repository, where a direct case-only `git mv` no-ops locally and then breaks on GitHub.
- `.gitignore` gained `.env*` and `.vercel`, committed **before** the credential existed. A key
  that reaches git history stays readable after the file is deleted.
- README and `RANKING-RULES.md` corrected where Problem Set 2 falsified them. "Front end only. No
  backend" and "No network calls of any kind" were both true until this version and are not now.
  `RANKING-RULES.md` gained a tenth section saying why the live figure deliberately ranks nothing.

### Removed

- **The cover screen's progress bar.** It carried `role="progressbar"` and `aria-label="Starting"`
  and counted 0 to 100 over three seconds, while nothing loaded — there was no `fetch`, no `await`
  and no `async` anywhere in `src/` when it was written. It reported the progress of a timer
  against that same timer and announced it to assistive technology as the application starting.
  Problem Set 2 calls this the claim that should not be there at all, and deleting it is the
  repair. It became untenable rather than merely wrong once the product gained two real loading
  states. The cover now holds on the wordmark and says "Tap to skip" from the first frame.

  The note below, from v2 batch 1, stays as written: it is an accurate record of a real problem
  with the CSS version and of why the bar was driven from state. It is now a note about something
  that no longer exists, which is the more useful lesson — the engineering was sound and the
  feature should not have been there.

### Fixed

- **FoodData Central answers nonsense with a success code.** Its search defaults to
  `requireAllWords=false`, so a query of pure gibberish returned HTTP 200, 111,423 hits and
  confident macros for oats. The obvious empty-state test, `totalHits === 0`, is therefore dead
  code that can never fire, and ingredients like galangal would have printed an unrelated food's
  figures under a USDA citation. `requireAllWords=true` makes a miss return an honest empty.
- **The first live call still returned the wrong thing.** Garlic came back as a Branded record —
  a packaged product whose label rounded protein to zero on a small serving, scaled up to 100 g.
  Status 200, a real record id, a real citation, protein 0 g. Raw garlic is 6.6 g.
  `dataType=Foundation,SR Legacy` restricts the search to analysed reference records.
- **`/api/nutrition` was an open proxy over a metered credential.** It took arbitrary text and
  passed it upstream; Vercel's edge cache keys on the full URL, so a stranger varying the parameter
  missed the cache every time and spent a slice of an hourly quota of 1,000. It now takes an
  ingredient id validated against the catalogue before the credential is sent anywhere, which also
  means no
  caller-supplied text reaches the upstream query string at all. Bounded at 93 cacheable queries.

### Note on what this version cost to verify

Two of the three defects above were found by reading a response rather than by running the code,
and neither would have been caught by a test that asserted the code does what it says. The check
that found the garlic figure was knowing that garlic has protein in it.

A third thing was learned the expensive way and is recorded in `assessment.md` B6: an audit run
against the live URL sent enough concurrent probe traffic to trip Vercel's attack mitigation, and
the site served a challenge page with a 403 to every visitor for several minutes. The graded
requirement is that a stranger can open the URL without being asked to sign in. Nothing in the code
was at fault; the fault was pointing a fan-out of probes at a production site that was about to be
marked.

## v2, batch 2 — the whole dataset, plus cuisine, vegetarian and price

*The dataset was replaced rather than extended, and the four meal preferences were deleted. This
is the batch where a human has to check numbers: 47 meals' macros and times, and 93 unit prices.*

### Added

- **Three cuisines** — Chinese, Western and Thai. Multi-select, and it excludes rather than
  scores. Japanese, French, Spanish and Italian remain unbuilt.
- **Vegetarian filter.** Derived from the ingredients, never hand-set per meal. 26 of the 93
  ingredients are non-vegetarian, and the five that matter are not meat at all — oyster sauce,
  fish sauce, both curry pastes and dried shrimp. A filter looking only for meat would call a
  Thai green curry vegetarian.
- **Price.** Every ingredient carries an invented unit price in Singapore dollars. The card shows
  price per person; the detail screen shows per person, whole dish, the cost of just the items
  you are missing, and a price on every ingredient row. Quantities, line prices, the whole-dish
  total and the shopping cost all scale with the serving control; price per person stays fixed,
  like calories per person. The prices are invented and no shop is named or implied.
- **Price sorting**, ascending or descending, along with the existing three.

### Changed

- **93 ingredients, up from 30.** Pork, chicken, beef and lamb split into cuts; six kinds of fish
  and seafood; the pantry split into Western, Chinese and Thai. The ingredient picker gained a
  second level for the two categories that needed it, so nobody scrolls past twenty-six pantry
  items to reach the beef.
- **47 meals, up from 11** — 17 Chinese, 16 Western, 14 Thai, spread 15 light / 17 medium /
  15 heavy, 14 of them vegetarian. Every ingredient is used by at least one meal, and every
  recipe line is consumed by a step.
- **Light / medium / heavy replaces the four meal preferences**, Fitness included. It is derived
  from calories per serving at 400 and 600, so the label on a card is a description of the figure
  beside it rather than a second opinion about the meal.
- **Units are declared once, on the ingredient.** A recipe line carries a bare number. v1
  repeated the unit on every line, which is how a price model drifts out of agreement with itself.
- The filter bar keeps sort and the two toggles visible and folds time, cuisine and weight — all
  answered two taps earlier on setup — behind one disclosure that names what is active.
- Cards show time, calories, price and servings. v1's "Serves" was the user's chosen party size,
  identical on every card and therefore carrying no information; it now shows the recipe's own
  base servings, which varies. Difficulty was Easy on most cards and moved to the tag row, where
  it costs no vertical space.
- The empty state now offers the undo for whichever filter is actually binding, instead of
  sending the user to another screen to guess.
- Every count on screen applies every filter except the one whose own label it sits on, and never
  a filter the user cannot see from where they are standing. This is the generalised form of the
  v1 counter defect in `prompts.md` §2.14.

### Removed

- The four meal preferences, and with them `fitnessSuitability`, `familyFriendly`,
  `preferenceScore` and `isStrongPreferenceFit`.
- **The "Recommended" and "Preference fit" sorts.** Both were scores over the preferences. With
  those gone, Recommended would have been ingredient match under a second name — two controls
  producing one list, which is exactly the defect `RANKING-RULES.md` recorded against v1's Regular
  preference. Deleted rather than reimplemented, which takes the sorts from five to four.

### Note on how the data was produced

The 47 meals were authored by three agents, one per cuisine, and then checked by three more
against the recipes. All three cuisines failed the first check, and the failures were not the kind
a schema catches: ingredients listed but never used by a step, macros that contradicted the
quantities, near-duplicate dishes, and steps calling for salt that was not in the ingredient list.
Structure and distribution were already perfect at that point, which is the useful part —
**"the numbers are compliant" and "the thing is right" turned out to be different questions.**

One of the failures was mine. The brief asked for at least five meals in each of three calorie
bands from a set of thirteen, which is arithmetically impossible, and two of the three authors
quietly shaved fat figures to protect the quota rather than saying so. The third said so. The
second pass told them to move a meal's band rather than shave a macro, which is what exposed it.

## v2, batch 1 — cover, sort direction, picker rework

*Interface work only. No new invented data, so nothing here needed a human to check a nutrition
figure.*

### Added

- **Cover screen.** Holds three seconds, then fades. Skippable by tap or any key, and skipped
  outright for anyone whose system asks for reduced motion.
- **Sort direction.** Cooking time, calories and ingredient match can be reversed. The control
  names the order in words — *Shortest first*, *Lightest first* — rather than showing a bare
  arrow. Recommended and Preference fit are scores, so they stay fixed and the control hides.
  Choosing a new sort starts it in its own natural direction instead of inheriting the last one.

### Changed

- **Ingredient picker is now an index rather than a wall.** Search first; your picks are echoed
  at the top where you can undo them; category groups collapse and their headers carry item and
  selected counts. The setup screen drops from **2,930px to 1,559px** at 375px wide, which puts
  the "how many people" question in the first viewport instead of two screenfuls down. Done ahead
  of the ingredient list growing from 30 to roughly 60 in batch 3, where the old layout would not
  have fitted.
- The five sort comparators are replaced by one key function per sort plus a single direction
  rule. Ties break toward what the user can actually cook, in every sort.

### Fixed

- `display: grid` on a collapsed panel beat the `hidden` attribute's own `display: none`, so
  collapsing an ingredient group left its chips on screen. `[hidden]` now wins explicitly.

### Note on the progress bar

The cover's bar is driven from React state on a 50ms tick, not from a CSS keyframe. The keyframe
version reported itself as `running` with the correct 3000ms duration while its clock sat at zero,
which rendered the bar at zero width and perfectly still — the exact frozen-app impression the
cover exists to prevent. A CSS transition on the width failed the same way, and so did the delayed
fade-in on the "tap to skip" hint. All three now key off the same timer that dismisses the cover,
so the bar and the dismissal cannot disagree, and a throttled clock makes the bar jump forward
rather than sit at zero.

## v1 — submitted version · tag `v1-submitted`

Three screens taking a home cook from *what is in my fridge* to *here is what to cook and how
much of it*: ingredient picker, ranked recommendations with ingredient-match percentages, and a
detail screen whose serving control rescales every quantity while calories per person stay fixed.
30 invented ingredients, 11 invented meals, four meal preferences including Fitness.

Front end only. No backend, no network calls, no accounts. All data invented and held in one file.

Notable fixes made before submission:

- The Find Meals counter ignored the selected ingredients, so it read the same number whether
  nothing or fourteen things were ticked (`prompts.md` §2.14).
- Whole-dish calories disagreed with whole-dish macros on 9 of the 11 meals, because the
  per-serving figure was rounded before being multiplied (`prompts.md` §2.17).
- The match bar's four fill colours measured 1.05:1 to 1.19:1 against the card and did not order
  correctly by lightness; four palette tokens failed WCAG 1.4.3 across about a dozen uses
  (commit `43d3345` — this one is not in `prompts.md`, whose log deliberately stops at the first
  push).
- `tools/build_preview.py` carried the repository's only external URLs and its only real company
  name, in a project whose own guardrails forbade both. Removed.

## Planned

What was planned as batches 2 and 3 shipped together in commit `09af03b`, and the documents were
brought back into line straight after, so the roadmap in
[`REFLECTION.md`](REFLECTION.md)'s further-action section is now spent. What is left, none of it
started:

- **A cook plan and shopping list** — mark several meals, get one merged list of what to buy.
  Blocked on a real limit rather than on effort: the pantry is a boolean, so the app knows you
  have garlic but not how much, and a merged list will confidently omit an ingredient you are
  three cloves short of.
- **Remembered staples**, in browser storage, so the ingredient list is not re-ticked every visit.
- **The four remaining cuisines** — Japanese, French, Spanish, Italian.

Halal filtering was considered and dropped. A halal claim depends on slaughter method,
certification and cross-contamination, none of which an ingredient list records, so the app could
only ever have said "contains no pork or alcohol according to this prototype's invented data" —
which is not what a user reading a halal filter would take it to mean.
